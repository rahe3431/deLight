## FollowMe
Looked into this existing feature banch off pokeemerald, might be useful for writing the pathing algorithm for enemies. Or maybe they don't have to be even that smart? Maybe could be a specific enemy type? Regardless, I have a feeling it can be useful somewhere https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald/tree/follow_me
